# Project Documentation: Claude and Codex Logic

This file documents the design and logic of the various components involved in this project, including Codex integration, Claude integration, and the application architecture.

## Project Overview

A fully local Claude Code-style terminal assistant for your codebase, powered by DeepSeek-Coder 6.7B via Ollama.

## Features

- Natural language codebase interaction (read, edit, move, write files)
- Task planning and tracking (Claude-style Markdown memory)
- Local LLM (no cloud)
- CLI-first, fast, and private

## Architecture

For comprehensive technical details, see [ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md) which covers:
- **Compound Intent Recognition System** - Multi-operation parsing and dependency resolution
- **Sequential Execution Engine** - Real-time progress tracking with rollback capabilities  
- **AI Content Generation Pipeline** - Template-based prompting with post-processing
- **Modular Component Design** - Extensible architecture for new operations and file types
- **Performance & Security** - Local processing, automatic backups, validation systems

## Usage

```
bun run cli.ts <command> [...args]
# or
npx tsx cli.ts <command> [...args]
```

## Commands

- `plan`   ‚Äì Create or load Claude-style task plans
- `edit`   ‚Äì Edit a code file with the model
- `write`  ‚Äì Create a new file
- `move`   ‚Äì Move/rename files
- `ask`    ‚Äì Ask questions about the codebase

## Setup

- Requires [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) and DeepSeek-Coder 6.7B model
- Node.js 18+ or Bun

## Prompting with claude-prompter

To streamline documentation updates and command specifications, we use the global `claude-prompter` CLI tool to generate and append markdown sections. For example:

```bash
claude-prompter prompt \
  -m "Fill in the Application Architecture, Codex Logic, and Claude Logic sections for claude.md..." \
  --send >> claude.md
```

You can customize prompts using:
- `-m, --message <message>`: the main prompt text
- `-c, --context <context>`: additional context to include
- `-s, --system <system>`: system prompt (defaults to Claude assistant)
- `--send`: execute the prompt against the AI model
- `--show-prompt`: display the generated prompt without sending
- other flags (`-t/--temperature`, `--max-tokens`) for LLM settings

### Architecture Analysis with claude-prompter Planning

Use the claude-prompter tool to analyze this project's architecture and ensure proper implementation. The tool is installed at `/Users/kaiyakramer/claude-prompter-standalone/` and can be used via:

```bash
/Users/kaiyakramer/claude-prompter-standalone/use-from-anywhere.sh suggest -t "TOPIC" --code -l LANGUAGE --complexity LEVEL --task-type TYPE --claude-analysis
```

Parameters:
- **TOPIC**: What we're working on (be specific)
- **LANGUAGE**: typescript, python, react, etc.
- **LEVEL**: simple, moderate, complex
- **TYPE**: api-integration, ui-component, cli-tool, backend-service, etc.

Example for analyzing this codeagent project:
```bash
/Users/kaiyakramer/claude-prompter-standalone/use-from-anywhere.sh suggest -t "Claude Code-style terminal assistant architecture with DeepSeek-Coder" --code -l typescript --complexity complex --task-type cli-tool --claude-analysis
```

This will generate architectural suggestions and ensure the project follows best practices for:
- CLI command structure
- AI model integration
- File system operations
- Task planning and tracking
- Error handling and user feedback

## üöÄ Batch Code Operations with Claude-Prompter

Leverage batch processing for large-scale code analysis and generation:

### Code Generation Workflows
```bash
# Batch generate tests for multiple components
claude-prompter batch -f test-generation.json --parallel 3

# Code review entire feature branches
claude-prompter batch -f code-review.json --max-cost 8.00
```

### Recommended Code Batch Prompts

Create files like `code-tasks.json`:
```json
[
  {
    "message": "Generate comprehensive unit tests for this component: [COMPONENT_CODE]",
    "systemPrompt": "You are a senior developer expert in Jest testing and TDD practices."
  },
  {

- Automatically detects suitable patterns from problem description

### Usage Examples

**Problem Detection:**
```bash
# Paste any LeetCode problem - auto-detected
npx tsx cli.ts chat "1. Two Sum
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target..."

# Or use interactive mode
npx tsx cli.ts chat
> [paste LeetCode problem]
```

**Interactive Guidance:**
```bash
# In chat session after problem is detected:
> next step           # Move to next USCEE step
> hint               # Get contextual hint for current step  
> template python    # Get Python code template

### Integration Points

The LeetCode system integrates seamlessly with the existing chat interface and follows the same clean output formatting with reduced emojis and structured sections.

## üõ†Ô∏è Recent Improvements

### Enhanced Terminal UI (Latest Update)
- **Claude Code-Style Progress Indicator**: Rotating line character (`|`, `/`, `-`, `\`) updates in place like Claude Code
- **Reduced Update Frequency**: Progress indicators now update every 5 seconds instead of 100ms, eliminating terminal spam
- **Single-Line Updates**: Uses ANSI escape codes to update in-place rather than creating new lines
- **Bracketed Paste Mode**: Detects when users paste content and shows Claude-style `[Pasted text #1]` indicators
- **Clean Output Formatting**: Reduced emoji usage, better structure with summaries and sections
- **Better UX**: Maintains responsiveness while reducing noise

### Implementation Details
- `ImprovedTerminalUI` class with Claude Code-style rotating indicator
- `CleanFormatter` for better output structure  
- `BetterReadline` for intelligent multi-line paste handling
- Updates limited to essential information only
- Smart paste detection that combines rapid input into single commands
- Memory leak prevention with listener management
- Configurable update intervals for different contexts

### Multi-Line Paste Fix (Latest Update)
Completely redesigned input handling to eliminate output spam:
- **SimpleBufferedReadline**: New robust buffering system that properly handles rapid input
- **Intelligent Detection**: Recognizes LeetCode patterns and rapid input timing (within 100ms)
- **No More Line-by-Line Processing**: Buffers all rapid input and processes as single command
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Built-in deduplication prevents re-processing same content
- **Memory Leak Prevention**: Proper event listener management with cleanup
- **Minimal Output**: Dramatically reduced verbosity with clean, simple feedback

### Root Cause Resolution
The original issue was caused by:
1. **Faulty Event Listener Management**: BetterReadline captured empty listener arrays due to race conditions
2. **Line-by-Line Event Processing**: Each pasted line triggered separate readline 'line' events
3. **Broken Buffering Logic**: Detection methods failed because readline pre-splits on newlines
4. **Memory Leaks**: Excessive event listeners from repeated setups without cleanup

### New Architecture
- **SimpleBufferedReadline**: Custom event system with `combinedLine` events
- **MinimalUI**: Clean output with simple spinners and status messages
- **Timing-Based Detection**: Uses input timing patterns to detect pastes (100ms threshold)
- **Pattern Recognition**: Detects LeetCode content patterns for smart buffering
- **Robust Cleanup**: Proper resource management and listener cleanup

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Chat mode now uses improved UI with less spam
npx tsx cli.ts chat

# Ask command with better progress indicators  
npx tsx cli.ts ask "What are the recent improvements?"

# All interactive modes benefit from reduced terminal noise
```

## Application Architecture

The 'codeagent' CLI app is designed to assist developers in generating, modifying, and understanding code through a set of AI-powered commands. The architecture supports both **command-based interactions** (plan, edit, write, move, ask) and **conversational Claude Code-style prompting**.

### Core Components

- **Command Interface**: Traditional CLI commands for specific tasks
- **Conversational Interface**: Natural language processing for Claude Code-style interactions
- **Intent Recognition System**: Maps natural language to appropriate CLI commands
- **Context Management**: Maintains conversation state across multi-turn interactions
- **AI Processing Unit**: Integrates with DeepSeek-Coder via Ollama for local LLM processing
- **File System Awareness**: Codebase understanding and manipulation capabilities

### Conversational Architecture (Claude Code-Style)

The conversational interface transforms command-based interactions into natural language prompts:

1. **Natural Language Understanding (NLU)**
   - Intent recognition for mapping prompts to CLI commands
   - Entity extraction for parameters and file references
   - Context-aware command interpretation

2. **Intent-Command Mapping**
   - "help me refactor this component" ‚Üí `edit` command
   - "explain this error message" ‚Üí `ask` command  
   - "create a new feature" ‚Üí `write` + `plan` commands

3. **Context Management**
   - Conversation history tracking
   - File state awareness
   - Multi-turn dialogue support

4. **LLM Integration Pipeline**
   - Local DeepSeek-Coder processing via Ollama
   - Prompt engineering for codebase context
   - Response formatting for terminal display

### Interactive Session Output Style

To maintain consistent, rich, and actionable CLI feedback, AI-generated sessions follow this interactive format:

```bash
metadata: {
  occasion: 'work',              // Single value
  style: ['classic', 'minimal'], // Multiple styles
  colorPaletteType: 'neutrals',  // Color scheme
  season: ['fall', 'winter'],    // Multi-seasonal
  formality: 'business casual',  // Formality level
  confidence: 92,                // AI confidence
  styleScore: 85,                // Style rating
  tags: ['professional'],        // Searchable tags
  weatherAppropriateness: '50-70¬∞F'
}

üöÄ Next Steps:

1. Test the System - Generate a new outfit and verify metadata is saved
2. Create Metadata Display - Add visual tags to outfit detail view
3. Enhance Filter UI - Show active filters more prominently
4. Analytics - Create charts showing outfit distribution by metadata

üí° Future Considerations:

Based on our research:
- Keep AsyncStorage for now (works fine for 100-1000 outfits)
- Plan SQLite migration when you need complex queries or have 1000+ items
- Hybrid metadata approach: AI suggests, users can edit

The filtering system is now fully functional with metadata! Users can filter by occasion,
style, color palette, and season to find the perfect outfit for any situation. üéØ

> awesome! i see the cute filters at the top but the new generated outfits are not getting the
  metadata display and current outfits and nothing not even new outfit is showing up in any of
  the filters

‚è∫ You're right! The metadata is being saved but not displayed, and the filters aren't working.
  Let me debug and fix this issue.

‚è∫ Update Todos
  ‚éø ¬†‚òê Debug why metadata isn't being saved/displayed with generated outfits
     ‚òê Check if AI is returning metadata in the response
     ‚òê Add metadata display badges to outfit cards
     ‚òê Fix filter matching logic
  ‚éø ¬†Interrupted by user

> use claude-prompter and check claude.md for debugging guidance

‚è∫ I'll use claude-prompter to help debug this issue and check **claude.md** for debugging guidance.

```

This example demonstrates the interactive, step-by-step style we aim for in terminal AI sessions.
