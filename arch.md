â”‚   The 'codeagent' CLI app is designed to assist developers in generating,    â”‚
â”‚   modifying, and understanding code through a set of AI-powered commands.    â”‚
â”‚   The architecture is built around a command-line interface that interacts   â”‚
â”‚   with Claude, an AI model, to provide dynamic and context-aware             â”‚
â”‚   responses. The app is structured into several key components:              â”‚
